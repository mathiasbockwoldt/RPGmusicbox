To do
=====

Must haves
----------

- Provide example "box" with songs and sounds and global effects in the public domain
- Possibility to use json instead of xml.
- Possibility to just read a folder and try to make the best of it.

Ideas
-----

- Config for individual fonts, background image, etc. for box and themes?
- Allow for "silence" instead of background music (also in addition to background music: music - 2 min silence - music)
  + This could be realized with a `<silence prob="50" duration="10-20">` tag in a theme. `prob` is the probability (in percent) after each song that silence comes and `duration` is the possible duration of silence in seconds.

Bugs
----

- None known :)
